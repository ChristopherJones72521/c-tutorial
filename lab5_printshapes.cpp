// Here we are using the standard namespace
/* The built in C++ library routines are kept in the standard namespace. 
 * That includes stuff like cout, cin, string, vector, map, etc. 
 * Because these tools are used so commonly, it's popular to add "using namespace std" 
 * at the top of your source code so that you won't have to type the std:: prefix constantly.
 * HOWEVER, you will not want to get into the practice of this in future projects
 * namespace contains so many different routines that including it will 
 * increase the odds of a conflict with one of your routines
